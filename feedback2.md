You’re right to have a “gut feeling” that this is close but could still be sharpened. The manuscript is already very strong – conceptually coherent, well-situated in both MBT and Bayesian cognitive science, and the memo models genuinely do what you say they do. But there are a number of tweaks that could make it more convincing to reviewers and easier to edit going forward.

I’ll go section‑by‑section, then give some global “editing checklist” style advice.

⸻

1. Big‑picture feedback

What’s already working very well
	•	Clear, ambitious central claim: PDs as aberrant Bayesian inference within an atypical “language of thought” for social reasoning. ￼
	•	Strong integration of MBT: psychic equivalence, pretend, teleological modes are not just named; they’re mapped to specific computational patterns (priors, likelihoods, model structure, and inference “gating”). ￼
	•	memo is used in exactly the spirit that Chandra/Tenenbaum intend: an executable language of thought for ToM that can be perturbed to simulate pathology. ￼
	•	The clinical case simulations (BPD abandonment, NPD criticism) are vivid and readable; the numbers align intuitively with the described pathologies and the plots in the Supplementary material. ￼
	•	The hypotheses section is concrete and testable (H1–H3 etc.), with clear behavioral and neural predictions. ￼
	•	The conclusion and final discussion are nicely forward‑looking and connect to personalized/precision psychiatry. ￼

So this isn’t “broken”; it’s more about polish, emphasis, and tightening.

2. Title, abstract, and framing

Title

Toward a Computational Theory of Personality Disorders: Bayesian Inference and Domain‑Specific Languages of Thought ￼

Pros:
	•	It accurately reflects the content and ambition.
	•	“Toward” keeps the theoretical, non‑data nature honest.

Possible tweak options (not mandatory):
	•	To foreground MBT (since that’s a big selling point):
	•	Toward a Computational Theory of Personality Disorders: Bayesian Mentalizing, Domain‑Specific Languages of Thought, and Mentalization‑Based Treatment
That may be too long, but even “…and Mentalization‑Based Treatment” would flag the clinical anchor for Frontiers reviewers.

If you keep it as is, I think it’s still fine.

Abstract

The abstract is good but dense. It currently does:
	1.	PDs & mentalization.
	2.	Main hypothesis (aberrant Bayesian inference in a ToM LoT).
	3.	Introduce memo.
	4.	Clinical simulations.
	5.	MBT mapping.
	6.	Hypotheses and translational implications. ￼

Editing suggestions:
	•	Bring MBT earlier. Right now MBT appears in sentence 8; you could mention “MBT” in the second or third sentence to signal the clinical frame sooner.
	•	Clarify “what is new” in one explicit sentence. e.g.,
“This paper offers (i) a formal mapping between MBT’s pre‑mentalizing modes and Bayesian computational mechanisms, and (ii) executable memo models of canonical PD scenarios (BPD abandonment, NPD criticism) that illustrate how these mechanisms generate clinical phenomena.”
	•	Tighten jargon. For non‑cog‑sci clinicians, phrases like “rigid belief hierarchies” and “domain‑specific languages of thought” might be heavy. Consider adding one plain‑language gloss, e.g. “(in essence, a programmable ‘language of mental states’).”

⸻

3. Introduction & overview

The introduction is strong: it grounds PDs in mentalization, uses ICD‑11 severity/traits, and smoothly introduces MBT’s non‑mentalizing modes and the idea that PDs may reflect distorted ToM machinery. ￼

Concrete editing suggestions:
	1.	Clarify the scope of “personality disorders”.
You focus on BPD and NPD in the models, but the framing often says “PDs” generically. Add a short sentence acknowledging this:
“Although PDs are heterogeneous, we focus on borderline and narcissistic patterns as paradigmatic cases for our initial modeling demonstrations.”
	2.	More explicit “this is a theory/hypothesis paper.”
You say “novel hypothesis and theory” in the abstract, but it would help to add a sentence near the end of the introduction explicitly stating that there are no new empirical data, just simulations and theoretical predictions.
	3.	Roadmap paragraph is good; you can tighten it slightly.
The paragraph that begins “In the sections that follow, we develop a computational theory‑of‑mind account…” already gives a good roadmap. ￼
You might trim one or two examples there to keep the intro from feeling long; the details appear later anyway.
	4.	Make the Chandra / Houlihan links explicit earlier.
You already cite Chandra and Houlihan in the references. ￼
At the end of the intro, consider one sentence that explicitly aligns you with their programs:
	•	e.g., “We build on recent work treating theories of mind as domain‑specific languages of thought (Chandra et al.) and emotion as inference over a generative theory of mind (Houlihan et al.), extending these ideas into the clinical terrain of personality disorders.”

This will make reviewers immediately see the “Tenenbaum + Chandra + Houlihan + MBT” synthesis you’re aiming for.

⸻

4. Background section (Section 2)

2.1 Mentalization Deficits in PD

This section reads very well – clear, clinically grounded, and consistent with the MBT and ICD‑11 literatures. ￼

Small edits:
	•	You already contrast hypo‑ vs hypermentalizing and mention oscillations between pretend mode and psychic equivalence. ￼
	•	Consider adding one explicit sentence foreshadowing your computational mapping: e.g., “These modes can be seen as distinct “settings” of an internal inference engine – either shutting down mental state representations or overfitting to them.”

2.2 Bayesian brain / ToM models

You nicely explain inverse planning and Bayesian ToM models; you also gesture at predictive processing and precision. ￼

Suggested edits:
	•	Tighten the explanation of Bayesian ToM for clinical readers by explicitly relating priors, likelihoods, posterior to everyday mentalizing in one concise example (e.g., “friend cancels meeting”).
	•	Emotion/prediction error link to Houlihan: in this section or a short 2.3, you could explicitly mention Houlihan’s “emotion as computation over a generative ToM” and say that in PDs, both the social inference and the emotional prediction may be biased – setting up your later discussion of arousal/precision effects. Right now, Houlihan appears only in the references and in a late discussion paragraph about affective models. ￼

⸻

5. memo & domain‑specific languages of thought

The early “memo” description is excellent; it’s clear and almost reads like the memo paper’s “intro for outsiders” but adapted to clinicians. ￼

Improvements:
	1.	Separate conceptual vs technical description.
Currently, the “memo” paragraph mixes:
	•	conceptual claim (patients use different internal languages/programs), and
	•	practical description (memo syntax, compilation, etc.). ￼
For readability, consider:
	•	Paragraph 1: conceptual LoT view (“different implicit programming languages”).
	•	Paragraph 2: memo as a tool that instantiates this idea.
	2.	Add one micro‑example.
A 1‑sentence pseudo‑example (“if Jane believes Alex is unreliable, then she predicts…”), not real code, can concretize what a “program” looks like without scaring non‑technical readers.
	3.	Make explicit that memo is representative, not essential.
You implicitly say memo “and the approach it represents” is valuable; I’d add a sentence to the effect of: “Our claims are not tied to memo specifically; any suitable ToM‑oriented DSL could in principle play this role.”
This avoids the appearance of being a “memo‑advertisement”.

⸻

6. Mapping MBT modes to computation (Table 1 and surrounding text)

This is one of the strongest conceptual parts. The mapping from teleological, psychic equivalence, pretend, hyper‑ and hypomentalizing to specific computational features is clear and intuitive. ￼

Suggested refinements:
	1.	Make the dimensions explicit.
You already implicitly vary:
	•	Model structure complexity (shallow vs deep ToM).
	•	Prior strength.
	•	Use of evidence (likelihood weighting).
	•	Hypothesis-space size / overparameterization.
I’d explicitly name these 3–4 dimensions in the text right before or after Table 1, and note which modes map primarily to which dimension. That shows readers you have a principled “design space” not just a list.
	2.	Teleological vs hypomentalizing redundancy.
Teleological mode and hypomentalizing are very similar in your computational analogue. ￼
You might:
	•	Clarify teleological as state‑dependent fallback (under acute arousal), and
	•	Hypomentalizing as more trait‑like or globally truncated model.
	3.	Dynamic switching as central.
You mention a “stress switch” that toggles modes. ￼
Given MBT’s emphasis on arousal‑linked breakdown, you could give this a short explicit subsection or at least 2–3 sentences: what variable stands for “stress”, and how does it alter priors/likelihoods or language choice?
	4.	Potential addition: a small schematic figure of the “mode space” (even just in Supplementary) could help – e.g. axes for prior strength vs evidence sensitivity, marking where each MBT mode lies.

⸻

7. Case simulations (Section 3 + Supplementary)

3.1 BPD abandonment scenario

The Jane/Alex scenario is clinically plausible and the mapping to the code is clear. The narrative around how priors are set and how stress collapses alternatives is well done. ￼

Editing suggestions:
	•	Clarify what’s toy vs realistic.
You do hint that this is a “sandbox” and a simplified scenario. ￼
Add one explicit sentence acknowledging that the mental state space is deliberately minimal (abandoning vs caring etc.) for expository purposes.
	•	Code in main text vs Supplementary.
You include fairly detailed model description and then full code in the Supplementary. That’s good. For the main text, consider:
	•	Keeping only pseudo‑code or a very small code snippet, and
	•	Referring readers to Listing S1 for full implementation.
That keeps the article readable for clinicians while still being fully reproducible.
	•	Explain the numbers in words.
You give posterior probabilities and mention the shift vs secure baseline; consider adding a short interpretive sentence like: “In other words, the BPD‑like model is ~3–4× more likely to interpret the message as abandonment than a secure model, even when the content is neutral.”
	•	Connect to MBT modes explicitly.
You could explicitly label which part expresses psychic equivalence (e.g., “in this branch, evidence weight is reduced toward 0, approximating MBT’s psychic equivalence under stress”).

3.2 NPD criticism scenario

The NPD model is nicely contrasted with a realistic observer, and the “envy/malice” misattribution pattern is clear (75% vs 25% posterior). ￼

Editing suggestions:
	•	Make the lack of other‑focus more explicit in the model description. You do this by removing/weakening branches that represent concern for others’ feelings; you might spell that out in psychological terms: “John’s model rarely considers the hypothesis that the critic is trying to be helpful.”
	•	Briefly say whether this pattern could also be modeled as hypermentalizing vs as a trait prior (high self‑importance; threat sensitivity). Right now it reads more as priors; you might mention that in MBT terms, narcissistic patients can also hypermentalize with self‑referential narratives.

Supplementary code and figures

The Supplementary is excellent: each model has a clinical background, key computational features, code listing, results, and a figure. ￼  ￼

Minor edits:
	•	Colormaps and labels.
	•	Ensure axis labels (“P(interpretation | mild_critique)”) and tick labels are large enough and non‑jargony. ￼
	•	For MBT modes figure (S3), maybe reorder bars so “Healthy” is first, then psychic equivalence, pretend, hypermentalizing – that matches the narrative progression.
	•	Stray characters and encoding.
I noticed at least one odd character in the main text (“if stress ¿ threshold” in an earlier draft section; it may be a mis‑encoded ≥ or >). Scan your .tex/.pdf for these; they’ll annoy reviewers.

8. Hypotheses and empirical predictions (Section 5)

H1–H3 are a highlight — they translate the theory into precise, testable patterns. For example, H1 on PD‑specific biases in belief updating is very clear. ￼

Suggestions:
	1.	Tie each hypothesis more tightly to a model parameter.
For each H, add one explicit mapping:
	•	H1 → “weight of new evidence” parameter (w_evidence).
	•	H2 → “mode switch” context variable (stress) + disappearance of alternative‑hypothesis enumeration.
	•	H3 → which ICD‑11 traits correspond to which priors/likelihoods.
This makes it easier for readers to imagine what fitting the model to data would look like.
	2.	Bring Houlihan in here.
You already mention affective models later. ￼
For H2 or a new hypothesis H4, you could say: “Building on work conceptualizing emotions as inferences over a generative ToM (Houlihan et al.), we predict that PD patients’ affective responses to the same social event will show systematic biases that can be captured by the same model used to explain their mentalizing patterns.”

⸻

9. Discussion & conclusion

The Discussion nicely covers psychotherapy implications, psychoeducation, monitoring progress via tasks, developmental simulations, and translational neuroscience. ￼  ￼

Editing suggestions:
	1.	MBT practice link.
The passage describing therapy as Bayesian model calibration (adjusting priors and likelihoods) is beautiful and clinically intuitive. ￼
	•	You might anchor this explicitly to a Bateman & Fonagy concept (e.g., “following Bateman & Fonagy’s emphasis on arousal‑dependent mode shifts, we interpret MBT interventions as…”). This would make the connection to the MBT book even clearer.
	2.	Emotion and arousal.
You already talk about emotions as impacting precision and arousal feeding into priors. ￼
	•	This is a natural place to explicitly cite Houlihan’s framework again and say you see your work as complementing theirs: they model emotion given ToM; you model PD‑biased ToM itself.
	3.	Developmental angle.
The virtual child / attachment learning idea is compelling. ￼
	•	You could add one concrete thought experiment: “e.g., simulate a caregiver who is available 30% vs 70% of the time and see what prior over ‘others abandon me’ develops.”
	4.	Conclusion section.
The final 6.5 Conclusion is strong and already hedges appropriately (“hypothesis and theory at this stage; humans are not optimal Bayesians”). ￼
	•	I’d only suggest you add one sentence acknowledging limitations of memo/PPL themselves (e.g., the assumption of symbolic structure, resource constraints, etc.), since some reviewers may be more neural‑network‑friendly.

⸻

10. Front‑matter, author contributions, AI use

The Author Contributions section notes that GPT and Claude were used as AI assistants. ￼
	•	This is admirably transparent.
	•	Journals differ on how they want this phrased, but many now recommend something like “Large language models (OpenAI ChatGPT, Anthropic Claude) were used for [copy editing / code refactoring / idea exploration] under the supervision of the author. The AI systems are not listed as authors and bear no responsibility for the content.”
	•	You might want to adjust wording once you pick a journal, to match their policy, but conceptually you’re doing the right thing.

⸻

11. Supplementary methods: computation & reproducibility

The supplementary “Computational Methods” section is succinct and solid: you specify memo’s exact enumerative inference, give the Bayes formula, mention JAX compilation, and outline validation checks and reproducibility steps. ￼

Minor suggestions:
	•	Clarify complexity limits.
One sentence acknowledging that enumerative inference is tractable here because the state spaces are small, and that scaling to more realistic scenarios might require other inference schemes.
	•	Model validation.
You list basic checks (summing to 1.0 etc.). ￼
If you ever add even simple sensitivity plots (e.g., how posteriors change as priors are varied) in a future version, mention that as part of the validation – reviewers like to see that the model isn’t finely hand‑tuned.

⸻

12. Style, wording, and small‑scale edits

Recurrent phrases

You have a very readable style, but a few phrases recur frequently:
	•	“In other words”
	•	“In short”
	•	“In essence”
	•	“In this paper, we…”

You can keep some of these (they help clinicians), but during editing, try to prune repetitions within the same page to keep the prose tight.

Terminology consistency
	•	Use one spelling consistently: “mentalization” vs “mentalising” (you’re mostly using the -z form, which is fine).
	•	Be consistent with “MBT” vs “Mentalization‑Based Treatment (MBT)”; after first definition you can usually just use MBT.
	•	“Language of thought” vs “language‑of‑thought” vs LoT – choose one style and stick with it.

Formatting / LaTeX quirks
	•	Scan for mis‑encoded characters (e.g., “¿” for ≥, non‑breaking hyphens).
	•	Check that all quotes (“ ”) are consistent (no mixed straight vs smart quotes).

References

Your references list is already strong and includes exactly the “core” stuff: Bateman & Fonagy, Bach ICD‑11 volume, Griffiths/Chater/Tenenbaum, Chandra memo, Houlihan emotion prediction. ￼
	•	Once you pick a target journal, just ensure the formatting matches their style (e.g., DOIs, issue numbers).
	•	You may optionally add 1–2 canonical computational psychiatry references, but that’s icing rather than necessary.

⸻

13. How I’d prioritize edits if you’re revising

If you want a concrete “editing plan”:
	1.	Quick wins (high impact, low effort)
	•	Make the MBT + Chandra + Houlihan links explicit in the intro and Discussion.
	•	Clarify that this is a theoretical/simulation paper.
	•	Clean up small encoding issues and tighten repeated phrases.
	2.	Medium‑effort but high payoff
	•	Slightly restructure memo description (conceptual vs technical paragraphs).
	•	Add 2–3 sentences making the computational dimensions in Table 1 explicit and emphasize dynamic mode switching.
	•	Tie each hypothesis more explicitly to model parameters.
	3.	Optional, if you have time
	•	Add a short subsection or figure on “dynamic stress‑dependent switching” of modes.
	•	Add an explicit subsection connecting to Houlihan’s emotion‑as‑inference work (even 1–2 paragraphs).
	•	Maybe simplify code presence in main text to pseudo‑code, keeping full code in Supplement.

⸻

If you’d like, next step I can help you rewrite specific paragraphs (e.g., abstract, 2–3 key sections) in a more polished form while keeping your voice and technical content intact.
